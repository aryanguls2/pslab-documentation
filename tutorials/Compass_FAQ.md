PSLab is a small USB powered hardware extension for your Android phone or PC that lets you measure all kinds of things. PSLab comes with a built-in Oscilloscope, Multimeter, Wave Generator, Logic Analyzer, Power Source, and we are constantly adding more digital instruments. PSLab is many devices in one. Simply connect two wires to the relevant pins and start measuring. You can use our Open Source Android or desktop apps to view and collect the data.

Instruments

Frequently Asked Questions And Their Answers
=============================================
While many of us consider ourselves to know quite a lot about technology there is always something more to be learnt. Through this article I wish to clear all general and frequent questions about the functioning and uses of the PSLab Compass. Thus in case you want some of your doubts cleared and questions answered this is the right place.

1) How does the digital compass work? 
* **Ans :** Phones and other devices having digital compasses make use of magnetometers which change their resistance when they are placed in a magnetic field depending on their orientation.

2) How to start the compass instrument on the PSLab Android App ?
* **Ans :** 
   Step1 : Open the PSLab Android App

   Step2 : Navigate through the Instruments list until you come across the Compass option.

   Step3 : Open the Compass Instrument

   Step4 : Now rotate your device abit. The compass reading should change.

3) Can I change the axis along whcich the reading of the compass is being given ?
* **Ans :** Surely you can. Just follow the steps in the previou squestion and open the compass instrument on the PSLab app. Scrool to the bottom of the screen. You should see the option to change the required axis according to your orientation with respect to the ground.

4) How can I find directions using a compass on PSLab ?
* **Ans :** The basic methodlogy followed is same as that of a real compass. Assuming the direction between your iniotial and final destination is pointing due North, rotate the phone around until the compass needle aligns along the north direction on the compass. Once this is done, begin moving along that direction.

5) Can the data reading of the Compass be recorded on the PSLab app ?
* **Ans :** Yes, we have implemented a record and play function or a way to save and open configurations in the instruments on the Android and desktop app. Data you record can be imported into the apps and viewed. This feature is still under heavy development, but works well in most places. You can find it in the top bar of the apps. There are buttons to record, play, save and open data.

6) In case I face some issues where can I repot them ?
* **Ans :** We have issue trackers in all our projects. They are currently hosted on GitHub. In order to submit a bug or feature request you need to login to the service. [A list of our PSLab repositories is here](https://github.com/fossasia?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=pslab). Depending on the application of PSLab you are using , you may report the issue on their repective repositories on Github.
